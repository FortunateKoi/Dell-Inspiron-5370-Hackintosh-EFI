## Others
1. Due to the usage of Airportitlwm.kext, so my EFI can only support one version of macOS. I will upload different EFIs for different macOS versions ranging from Big Sur to Sonoma before September 2024. (I am a freshman to Github and I have to learn about how to upload files and create releases)
2. I am a senior high school student living in Suzhou, China, so obviously I am not a native-English speaker. I apologize for my bad grammar in this Readme :-(
3. Chinese Readme will be added before 1st August, 2024.
4. You can send emails to koi-95710@qq.com to give me a bug report. Please write emails in English or Simplified Chinese(Don't translate other language to Chinese by tools like Google translate because it is really hard to understand by native Chinese) otherwise I can not understand your report accurately. Also, please give me detailed information about the bug(s) as much as possible. Thank you very much! I will try my best to solve your problems within 15 days of you emailing me.
